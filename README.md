# scRNA-seq
Couple of scripts I used for scRNA-seq analysis

The sc_intro_practice script is a dimensionality reduction and clustering workflow to get familiar with Seurat objects, PCA, UMAP, and SNN clustering. 

The multiple_conditions script is a script to work with integrating multiple samples, as well as to use SingleR to annotate clusters.
